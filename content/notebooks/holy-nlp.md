### What's in this notebook?

This is the notebook behind my blog post [Holy NLP! Understanding Part of Speech Tags, Dependency Parsing, and Named Entity Recognition]({{< relref "blog/holy-nlp.md" >}}). It's an exploration into three common NLP tasks applied on the Bible as a corpus, with some pandas aggregations and seaborn plotting to round things out.
