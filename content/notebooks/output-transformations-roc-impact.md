### What's in this notebook?

This is the notebook behind my blog post [The Impact of Model Output Transformations on ROC]({{< relref "blog/output-transformations-roc-impact.md" >}}). It contains some seaborn plots, some pandas-fu with method chaining, a simulation of analyzing model results, and some plots with seaborn.
