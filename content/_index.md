Thanks for visiting. My name is Peter Baumgartner. Iâ€™m a data scientist working at RTI International, a non-profit research institute. I work on a wide array of projects that fall under the data science umbrella from one-off analyses to building software that helps researchers conduct their own analysis. My interests are applied machine learning and natural language processing.
